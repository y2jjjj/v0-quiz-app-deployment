## 🧩 Challenges & What I Solved

This was one of the most challenging apps I built recently because:

1. I had to design a **non-repeating random questioning logic**.
2. Ensure the quiz reshuffles automatically every week.
3. Maintain state across refreshes – without losing progress.
4. Implement Dark/Light theme toggle with persistent preference.
5. Scale question storage cleanly as the list crosses 150 items.

The final result is smooth, fast and easily extendable – more questions can be added anytime without breaking UI or logic.
